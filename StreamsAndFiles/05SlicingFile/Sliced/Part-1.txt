C#[note 2] (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.[12] Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 7.0 which was released in 2017 along with Visual Studio 2017.[13]The correct title of this article is C# (programming language).
